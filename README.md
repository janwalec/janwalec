## Exchange <img src="https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons/blob/main/flags/1x1/dk.svg" width="15" height="15"/>
I studied <b>Software Engineering </b>on an exchange at <b>Aarhus University</b>.
<br>All the courses were taught in English, with exclusive focus on working in groups,
<br>which I enjoyed the most.

## Language
I speak English fluently and I've passed <b>CAE Cambridge English</b> test.
<br> My exchange tested me even more in this field.
